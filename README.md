BulkAPI
=======

In order to write hybrid or native mobile application  - you often needs to communicate with your bussiness logic at your server.
You probably use and/or prefer JSON based REST API - likewise I do :) for better parsing and binding data.
While I was working with SenchaTouch framework (for frontend) I noticed that the REST URI style is not switable always - afterward I started working with PHP/MySQL/Apache to meet my requirements ... Perhaps I found indeed.

The BulkAPI library will let you write your business logic  efficiently using Object oriented PHP and currently only with MySQL database (though I'm working to add PDO instead mysqli, so that we can use 12 kindof DB)
The BulkAPI is designed to write API specially for Mobile Application and more particularly HTML5 hybrid applications.
So, most of required backend functionality has done on this library.

Have a look:
 1 Efficient and dynamic URL and parameter passing
 2 Lot's of module to devide the workflow
 3 Google Cloud Messaging module added to send push messages
 4 Full RESTful based header setup
 5 Easy and clear OOP coding
 6 Secured file system and very efficient uploading process
 7 XHR2 uploading process
 8 PhoneGap Camera photo upload system included
 9 Customizable file I/O and directory system
 10 Basic statistics provided for API usage
 
 and lot's more things - though it is an initial release.
